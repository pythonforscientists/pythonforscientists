### About the textbook

Python for Scientists is an open-source Python textbook designed for introductory courses in computer science or scientific computing. As opposed to other textbooks, which only cover the fundamentals of coding itself, Python for Scientists also provides students with good programming and development skills. Written for students at Kenyon College, it should also serve students at similar, small liberal arts institutions with its emphasis in Python as a tool in scientific computing.

### This edition includes:
- Fundamentals of programming
- Good coding practices
- Python in scientific computing using Jupyter Notebooks
- Data manipulation with Pandas and plotting with Matplotlib
- Basic statistical tests with statsmodels
- Web scraping tables with Beautiful Soup 4
